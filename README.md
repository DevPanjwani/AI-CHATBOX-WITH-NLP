##This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based chatbot developed in Python as part of Task-3 of the CODTECH Internship program. The objective of this project is to design and build a functional conversational system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques through the NLTK library. The chatbot operates in a command-line interface environment where it interacts with users in real time, accepts textual input, processes it using NLP preprocessing techniques, and generates the most relevant response from a predefined knowledge base. The system applies tokenization to break user input into meaningful components and utilizes lemmatization to normalize words into their base forms, improving the accuracy of textual comparison. By implementing a word similarity matching mechanism, the chatbot evaluates the overlap between processed user queries and stored sentences to determine the most appropriate reply. This approach demonstrates a rule-based conversational AI model, highlighting how foundational NLP methods can be used to simulate intelligent interaction without relying on external APIs or advanced machine learning models. The project reflects practical knowledge of text processing, logical decision-making, and structured program flow, while also emphasizing clean code organization and modular function design. Through this implementation, the repository showcases how basic conversational agents can be developed using core Python libraries, serving as a stepping stone toward more advanced AI-driven dialogue systems. The included source code and documentation provide a complete, reproducible example of building and executing a simple yet functional chatbot system for educational and learning purposes.
